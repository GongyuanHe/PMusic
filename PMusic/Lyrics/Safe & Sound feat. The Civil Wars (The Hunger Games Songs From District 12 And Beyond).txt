[00:14.14]I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go
[00:20.89]When all those shadows almost killed your light
[00:27.40]I remember you said don't leave me here alone
[00:33.89]But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
[00:40.89]Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
[00:48.14]You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
[00:54.64]Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
[01:20.39]Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
[01:26.90]The war outside our door keeps raging on
[01:33.89]Hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone, gone
[01:51.14]Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
[01:57.64]You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
[02:04.39]Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
[02:43.14]Just close your eyes, you'll be alright
[02:57.39]Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
